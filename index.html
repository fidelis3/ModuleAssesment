        <hr width="200" border="50" color="black">
        <p><span class="round-bullet"></span>My father is an oncologist and growing up,he would show us photos of his cancer patients.I remember the deep sadness and the loss of hope etched into their faces which often left me in tears.What struck me most was how much their confidence faded,especially from the visible physical changes like drastic weight loss and hair loss.That pain stayed with me.I knew then that i wanted to change their stories,to remind them that losing hair is not losing courage. It fulfills me deeply to bring light and dignity back into the lives of those who once felt invisible.</p>
